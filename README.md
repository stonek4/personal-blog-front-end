# Kevin Stoner's Personal Site Front End

This is my personal blog that I created as a fun experiment, and to use some tools and languages I haven't before.  It can be found at https://kevinstoner.me.  It is hosted 100% free using Firebase (for hosting), Cloud Run (free tier), and Mongo Atlas (free tier).  More details about implementation can be found [here](https://kevinstoner.me/blog/5d27bb7f5614ae5b7ae8d7f7)

The front end of this site is written in Angular.  It talks to a RESTful back end written in Express / Node.js.  As of now I am not going to release the code for the back end in order to keep it secure, however if you are interested let me know and I would be happy to share it!
